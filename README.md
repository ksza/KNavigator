KNavigator
==========

Written as my Highschool Thesis project in 2003, KNavigator is a replica written in TurboPascal 7 of the popular DosNavigator project.

Through this project I've managed two achieve two major things:
- create a working project implementing most of DosNavigator's functionality
- write a modula program in Turbo Pascal using the Object Oriented Programming features provided by the language since version 5.5

Although it cannot be called usefull anymore, I hope it will at least bring back some memories about the good old times... at least for some of you :)
